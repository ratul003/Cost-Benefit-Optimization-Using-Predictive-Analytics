# Determining the optimal stacking level in Bangladesh using Cost Benefit Analysis
 
 - This project was done as part of an initiative to drive Top Line profitability and maintain a healthy customer experience at an optimal cost efficiency for the largest food delivery platform Foodpanda | Delivery Hero in Bangladesh.
 
#### Breakdown: The project is divided into 3 stages -->
 - Data Extract/Transform/Load (Check SQL Query Doc)
 - Statistical Data Modeling (Check R HTML/RMD Doc)
 - Project Management and Execution (Check Google Slides)

## What? 
### Determining the optimal “ML Algo Order Assignment” stacking levels using Cost-Benefit Analysis

## Why?
#### Drive Benefits → 
  - Improve Fully Loaded Gross Profit Per Order
  - Improve Customer Experience 
  - Customer Reorder Rates
  - Customer Incident Rates (Extreme Delay, Late Orders etc)
  - Seamless Orders on Time 

#### Lower Costs →
  - Reactive & Proactive Compensation
  - Refund & Wallet Compensation
  - Rider Payments

## How?
  - Relative changes in Operational KPIs with an increase in stacking %
  - Covariance Test → measure the direction of the relationship between stacking % & operations metrics
  - Pearson Correlation Test → measure the strength of the relationship between the stacking % & operations metrics
  - Multi-Linear Regression Prediction Modeling → measure the impact of an X % increase in stacking levels on Top Line metrics

1. The objective of the project → What/ Why/ How
2. Explain the Rider Assignment Journey with the stacking concept
3. Targetted Ops KPIs to measure the impact of stacking increase from Central Team
4. PRE and WORST Performance metrics VISUALS during the stacking experiment for cost reduction

Metrics include → 
  ##### Cost :- Delivery Time, Delayed Orders %, Customer Contact Rate, Compensation Cost Per Order, Refund Cost Per Order, Seamless Orders %
  ##### Benefits :- Rider CPO, Rider Efficiancy Rate
